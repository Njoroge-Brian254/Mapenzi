    <h1><u>To my queen</u></h1>
    <p>
        From the first day i met you, maisha yangu imebadilika pakubwa.Moyo wangu wabubujikwa na mapenzi chungu nzima.
        You have been the better half that i used to dream off in the beginning of my puberty period.Through shaky waves that almost capsized our ship ,you have held the steering wheel of our rellationship firmly just like a captain would do.<br>
        I might not give you the world as many conspire to deceive their partners but there's something great we are building together as partners.Before I was nervous of engaging in love only fate had it's miracles in bringing us together,
        I pray that the Almighty may be our driver in our relationship and may fulfil our prayers of love,wealth,unity and satisfaction in our love.
